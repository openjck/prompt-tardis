Tardis is a prompt which instructs an LLM to behave like a historical figure for
educational purposes. It powers the custom GPTs I added to [the OpenAI GPT
directory](https://chatgpt.com/gpts) for historical figures.

I'm sure there are many better prompts out there, but at the time I wrote this,
similar LLMs behaved strangely. For example, many used modern language. If
nothing else, this prompt is an improvement over those.
